Schedule Posts and Pages to automatically expire and change at a certain time, and provide notification of expiration.

== Description ==

Content Scheduler lets you schedule Posts and Pages to automatically expire at a certain time.
Expiration Options
You control what happens upon expiration, including:

* Change status to Pending, Draft, or Private
* Unstick Posts
* Change Categories
* Move to the Trash

Notification Options
Content Scheduler can also notify you:

* When expiration occurs
* A specific number of hours before expiration occurs

This reminder helps you keep content fresh, providing a reminder that content is out of date and needs updated or replaced. Content Scheduler lets you use notification tools without making any changes to content upon expiration, if you'd like.

== Installation ==

To install Content Scheduler:

1. Upload the "content-scheduler" directory and all its contents to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Visit the 'Content Scheduler' options through the 'Settings' menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where did you get the datepicker used in this plugin? =

That's the ["Any+Time" date / time picker:](http://www.ama3.com/anytime/)

= Does Content Scheduler work with Network / Multisite installations?

Maybe. All the code is in there to make it work, but we need to do more testing before claiming it is working. This is the main reason the plugin is currently at version 0.9 instead of 1.0.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Content Scheduler options screen, where you determine what happens when the expiration date is reached.
2. Content Scheduler can optionally display the expiraton date and status in a column where your Posts and Pages are listed.
3. Scheduling content expiration uses a small, unobtrusive box on your Post and Pages edit screens.
